GlowPulse — Minimal wellness dashboard (Vite + React + Tailwind)

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

1. Install dependencies

```powershell
cd "c:\projects\Ui designs\Glowpulse"
npm install
```

2. Run dev server

```powershell
npm run dev
```

3. Open the local dev URL printed by Vite.

Notes:
- The UI uses Tailwind CSS. After running `npm install`, run `npm run dev` to start the Vite dev server.
- All graphics are SVG or CSS-based (no external image assets).
- Main app file: `src/App.jsx` (components are colocated for copy-paste ease).
